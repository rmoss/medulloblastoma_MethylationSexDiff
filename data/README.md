`data` directory organization:

- `raw` contains raw files as they came from experiment results or an external source.
These files should generally not be modified once created.
Examples of such data are lab instrument output files, sequencing data from a core facility, or expression data downloaded from a repository.

- `processed` may contain modified versions of the `raw` files, after steps like filtering, sorting, trimming, etc.

- `reference` contains files like genome annotations, mapping indices, or gene lists that are not specific to the project, but may be required for analysis.
