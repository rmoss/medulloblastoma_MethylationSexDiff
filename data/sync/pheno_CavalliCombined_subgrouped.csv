DNA was extracted from the digest with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in TE buffer. Bisulfite conversion was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation Kit","Cy3 and Cy5","Standard Illumina Protocol",9606,"Standard Illumina Protocol","Samples were processed as per manufacturer’s instructions. Raw data files (.idat) generated by the Illumina iScan array scanner","Raw data was processed in R using the minfi (v1.6.0) and IlluminaHumanMethylation450kmanifest (v0.4.0) R Bioconductor packages. We checked all samples for unexpected genotype matches by pairwise correlation of the 65 genotyping probes on the 450k arrays, allowing us to remove remaining duplicates. We ran the detectionP function from the minfi package to identify probes and samples with low quality. Samples were removed if more than 1% of their probes had a p-value above 0.01 and probes were removed if their p-value was above 0.01 in at least 5% of samples.  We removed probes on sex chromosomes as well as those located on or close to known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). We retained a total of 321,174 probes for the analysis. The data was normalized using the SWAN method (Makismovic et al., Genome Biology 2012) as implemented in the minfi package.  The matrix of normalized beta values is available on the series record.","GPL13534","Florence,M G,Cavalli","fmgcavalli@gmail.com","Developmental and Stem Cell","The Hospital for Sick Children","PGCRL, 686 Bay Street","Toronto","Ontario","M5G 0A4","Canada","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2261nnn/GSM2261507/suppl/GSM2261507_9323071066_R01C02_Grn.idat.gz","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2261nnn/GSM2261507/suppl/GSM2261507_9323071066_R01C02_Red.idat.gz",0,"Reanalyzed by: GSM3876875","Group4","Group4_beta","medulloblastoma","primary tumor","MB_Gr4",0.951
